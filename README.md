# Information about the Innovation Script

The main idea of this script it is structure a compile of routines that could be useful for insight external data for Innovation Management practices. Here, I try to combine several data mining of differents sources of data that could give sign of multiples patterns and indications to innovate. 

Althougt this is a introdutory analysis and this will be constantly update until the shiny dashboard finish.

The differents kinds of analysis are structure according the division below:

### Patent
The Patents analysis use the keyword "Autonomous vehicles" on Derwent system (Web of Knowledge). The dataset include the register of patent, Title, inventors, owner, abstract and categories. Until July 28th, we did analyse the Owners and categories. We identified that the Derwent dataset does not have the Keywords, countries, year and references that reduce some analysis. 

The next step is download the data of USPTO. 

### Bibliometric
After download a raw data of Isi web of knowledge, the routine make bibliometric and scientometric analysis. The next step is download other sample with more results. Until July 28th, we did analyse the core of scientometric analysis. 

### Twitter

The analysis of Twitter for "Autonomous Vehicles" does not help for any technology insight, the keywords analysis was done but we need more studies in extract a type of sentiment analysis.
